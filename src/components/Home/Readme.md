To create a slide show in React, you can create a component that holds the images and use state to keep track of the current slide. 
You can use setInterval to change the current slide after a certain amount of time. 
Here is an example of what a slide show component might look like:

javascript
Copy code


```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const images = [
  { src: "/img1.jpg", alt: "Image 1" },
  { src: "/img2.jpg", alt: "Image 2" },
  { src: "/img3.jpg", alt: "Image 3" }
];

const SlideShow = () => {
  const [currentSlide, setCurrentSlide] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setCurrentSlide(prevSlide => (prevSlide + 1) % images.length);
    }, 2000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <img src={images[currentSlide].src} alt={images[currentSlide].alt} />
    </div>
  );
};
```
export default SlideShow;
In this example, images is an array of image objects,
 and currentSlide is a state variable that keeps track of the current slide. 
 The useEffect hook is used to change the current slide every 2 seconds using setInterval.
  Finally, the component returns an image element with its src and alt attributes set to the current slide's properties
